## FEEL LIKE PASTA FOR DINNER?

Ciao Bello!

This app allows you to add ingredients you have in the fridge or pantry as tags. 

The search engine returns recipes containing the ingredients you list. The more ingredients you add, the more specific the results will be.

I used the Streamlit library to create the project and scraped the recipes from my favourite italian recipe Youtuber, Vincenzo's plate, using the BeautifulSoup web scraping library, and saved them to a CSV file using Pandas.

What sets this app apart from the generic streamlit template is the use of st.markdown to customise the styling of the page using CSS and an AI generated image (using Dalle 2). I have also made use of the new streamlit tags component to add filtering functionality to ingredients in the search.

Please follow Vincenzo so he can continue to share amazing recipes, and I can keep my wife happy with amazing food :-) https://www.vincenzosplate.com/

Cheers,
Yon
